# Dijkstra's Algorithm Testing

## Input

Enter the number of nodes: 5

Enter the number of edges: 7

Enter the edges in the format (u v weight):

0 1 10

0 4 3

1 2 2

1 4 4

2 3 9

3 4 7

4 2 2

Enter start node: 0

Enter end node: 3


## Output

Shortest path cost: 10

Path: 0 4 3

## Explanation

**Graph Description**: The graph consists of 5 nodes and 7 edges. Each edge connects two nodes with a specified weight.

**Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Computes the shortest path from node 0 to node 3.
 
**Result**: The shortest path from node 0 to node 3 is through nodes 0 → 4 → 3 with a total cost of 10.
